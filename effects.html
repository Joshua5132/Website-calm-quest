            <h2>Anxiety:</h2>
            <h4>Anxiety can show up in teens in different ways, such as worrying too much, feeling irritable, withdrawing from friends, having trouble focusing, and experiencing physical issues like headaches or stomach-aches. Some teens might avoid difficult situations, try to be perfect all the time, or get very upset by criticism. Others might skip school or use substances to cope. If anxiety is not treated, it can lead to depression. Anxiety can really affect teens in a lot of ways. Some common signs include:</h4>

        <div class="text3"><h2>Eating Disorders:</h2><p>The exact cause of eating disorders is not fully understood, but experts think it's a mix of genetics (about 40-60%) and environmental factors. Some people may inherit a higher risk, and life events—like dieting or experiencing trauma—can trigger these disorders. Over time, these behaviours can become habits that are tough to break. It is important to remember that having an eating disorder is not anyones fault, and seeking help early can improve the chances of recovery. </p></div>
