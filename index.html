        <div class="text2"><h1>Types:</h1> <h3>Teenagers in New Zealand face various emotional challenges that significantly impact their well-being. Here are the 5 most common ones:</h3>
            <p> Anxiety is a common issue, often characterized by excessive worrying and restlessness, which can interfere with daily life.</p>  

                <p>Depression affects many young people, leading to feelings of sadness and hopelessness that can impair school performance and social relationships. </p>
                
                <p>Eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia, are serious conditions linked to unhealthy eating behaviours and body image concerns, often fuelled by societal pressures.</p>  
                
                <p>Suicidal tendencies pose a severe risk, with many teens experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, making it crucial to address mental health early.</p>  
                <p>  Lastly, the influence of social media can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and anxiety, as teens navigate online comparisons and cyberbullying.</p>

        <div class="text3"><h1>Effects:</h1><p>Mental health affects how we think, feel, and act. Poor mental health can lead to problems like stress, anxiety, or depression, making it harder to handle everyday tasks, work, or relationships. It can also cause physical issues, like headaches or tiredness. If not treated, mental health problems can make life less enjoyable and lead to more serious issues, like substance abuse or self-harm. Taking care of mental health is important for overall well-being and helps people live better, happier lives.</p>
