            <h2>Anxiety:</h2>
            <p>The main effects of anxiety in teenagers include feeling constantly agitated, sensitive to criticism, excessive worrying, avoiding new situations, being withdrawn, difficulty concentrating, trouble sleeping, and changes in eating habits. Physical symptoms can involve a racing heart, dizziness, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, stomach discomfort, headaches, and muscle aches.

            <h2>Depression:</h2>
            <p>Depression in adolescents is a major mental health concern, affecting around 16% of 10-19-year-olds globally. It significantly impacts school performance, social relationships, and emotional well-being, often going untreated. Depression can lead to long-term mental and physical health issues and increase the risk of suicide, which is one of the leading causes of death in this age group. Early intervention, supportive environments, and accessible mental health care are critical to improving outcomes for affected adolescents (World Health Organization, 2024). </p></div>

            <h2>Eating Disorders:</h2><p>Eating disorders are serious mental health issues linked to unhealthy eating habits and worries about body image. Common types include anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder. These disorders can have big physical and emotional effects on a person. Research shows that getting professional help early can lead to better recovery outcomes. </p> <p> Eating disorders can affect how you think and feel about food and your body. They can make you eat too little, binge eat, exercise excessively, or make yourself vomit. Cultural pressures and social media often make people feel insecure about their appearance, leading to unhealthy relationships with food and body image. Some people might be more prone to developing these issues due to genetics and life experiences. They are serious problems that can affect your life and health, but recovery is possible with the right help. If you or someone you know needs support, don't hesitate to reach out!

            <h2>Social Media:</h2>
            <p>Social media can have both positive and negative effects on teenagers in New Zealand. On one hand, it offers a platform for connection and support; on the other, it can contribute to issues like cyberbullying, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Social media can create unrealistic expectations, leading to comparison and dissatisfaction with oneself. It's essential for teens to use social media mindfully and for parents to engage in conversations about online safety and mental health. </p></div>
